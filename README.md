- **`register_graphql_subscription()` API** - Developer-friendly subscription registration
- User authentication/authorization for subscriptions
- Additional subscription types (comments, users, taxonomies, etc.)
- WebSocket transport option
- Production optimization and scaling

### üìã Planned Features
- Client-side subscription management libraries
- Rate limiting and connection throttling
- Redis/external cache support for high-scale deployments

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Ensure you have WPGraphQL installed and activated
3. Activate the "WPGraphQL Subscriptions" plugin
4. The plugin will automatically create the required database table

## Basic Usage

### 1. GraphQL-SSE Protocol Usage

The plugin implements the [GraphQL-SSE specification](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) for real-time subscriptions.

#### Make a Reservation (PUT)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/graphql/stream', {
  method: 'PUT'
});
const token = await response.text(); // Connection token
```

#### Execute GraphQL Operation (POST)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/graphql/stream', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-GraphQL-Event-Stream-Token': token
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `subscription {
      postUpdated(id: "394") {
        id
        title
        status
        content
        date
        modified
        author {
          node {
            id
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }`,
    extensions: {
      operationId: 'my-subscription-001'
    }
  })
});
```

#### Establish SSE Connection (GET)
```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/graphql/stream?token=${token}`);

eventSource.addEventListener('next', function(event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('GraphQL result:', data.payload);
  /*
  Example result:
  {
    "data": {
      "postUpdated": {
        "id": "cG9zdDozOTQ=",
        "title": "My Updated Post",
        "status": "publish",
        "content": "<p>Updated content...</p>",
        "date": "2025-08-07T20:26:32",
        "modified": "2025-08-07T20:55:03",
        "author": {
          "node": {
            "id": "dXNlcjox",
            "name": "jasonbahl"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  */
});

eventSource.addEventListener('test', function(event) {
  console.log('Connection test:', JSON.parse(event.data));
});
```

### 3. Test Events

Update any WordPress post and connected clients will receive real-time notifications.

## Architecture

### Event Flow

```
WordPress Hook ‚Üí Event Emitter ‚Üí Database Queue ‚Üí SSE Streams ‚Üí Clients
```

1. **WordPress Events** - Standard WP hooks (`wp_insert_post`, etc.)
2. **Event Emitter** - Standardizes and emits subscription events
3. **Database Queue** - Stores events for reliable multi-process delivery
4. **SSE Streams** - Long-running HTTP connections that poll for events
5. **Client Applications** - Receive real-time GraphQL subscription results

### Key Components

- **`WPGraphQL_Event_Emitter`** - Central event emission system
- **`WPGraphQL_Event_Queue`** - Database-backed event storage
- **`WPGraphQL_Subscriptions_Stream`** - SSE endpoint handler
- **`WPGraphQL_Subscription_Manager`** - Plugin coordination and schema registration

## Configuration

### PHP-FPM Settings

For multiple concurrent SSE connections, ensure adequate PHP-FPM workers:

```ini
; In your PHP-FPM pool configuration
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 10        ; Increase from default
pm.start_servers = 3
pm.min_spare_servers = 2
pm.max_spare_servers = 5
```

### WordPress Settings

No special WordPress configuration required. The plugin works with standard WordPress installations.

## Development

```

### WP-CLI Commands

```bash
# View queue statistics
wp wpgraphql subscription stats

# Test event emission
wp wpgraphql subscription test-event --type=postUpdated --node-id=123

# Clean up old events and expired connections
wp wpgraphql subscription cleanup --hours=1 --connections

# Create database table
wp wpgraphql subscription create-table
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by adding to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
// Enable WPGraphQL debug mode to see admin interfaces
define('GRAPHQL_DEBUG', true);
```

Then visit **GraphQL ‚Üí Subscription Queue** in WordPress admin.

## Troubleshooting

### Multiple Connections Freezing

This usually indicates PHP-FPM process pool exhaustion. Increase `pm.max_children` in your PHP-FPM configuration.

### Events Not Appearing in Streams

1. Check that database tables exist:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wpgraphql_subscription_events';
   SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wpgraphql_subscription_connections'; 
   SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_wpgraphql_subscription_documents';
   ```
2. Verify events are being stored: `SELECT * FROM wp_wpgraphql_subscription_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`
3. Check subscriptions are registered: `SELECT * FROM wp_wpgraphql_subscription_documents`
4. Check error logs for PHP or database errors

### Session Blocking Issues

The plugin automatically calls `session_write_close()` to prevent session locking. If you're still experiencing issues, ensure no other plugins are starting sessions after the SSE stream begins.

## Scaling & Performance Considerations

### Database Load Concerns

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The current database-based storage is designed for **development and small-to-medium production sites**. For high-traffic scenarios, consider these scaling implications:

#### Event Queue Load
```sql
-- High-frequency events can generate significant database writes
INSERT INTO wp_wpgraphql_subscription_events (event_type, node_id, data, created_at)
-- Every post update, comment, user change, etc.
```

#### Connection Storage Load  
```sql
-- Every SSE connection queries these tables every second
SELECT * FROM wp_wpgraphql_subscription_connections WHERE token = ?;
SELECT * FROM wp_wpgraphql_subscription_documents WHERE connection_token = ?;
```

### Performance Recommendations by Scale

#### **Small Sites (< 10 concurrent SSE connections)**
- ‚úÖ **Database storage is fine** - Current implementation works well
- ‚úÖ **Default cleanup intervals** - Hourly cleanup sufficient

#### **Medium Sites (10-100 concurrent connections)**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor database performance** - Watch for slow queries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optimize cleanup frequency** - Consider 15-minute intervals
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Database indexing** - Ensure proper indexes on timestamp columns

#### **Large Sites (100+ concurrent connections)**
- ‚ùå **Database storage not recommended** - Switch to Redis/Memcached
- ‚ùå **High database load risk** - Event queue writes + connection polling
- ‚úÖ **External storage required** - Redis, Memcached, or custom solution

### Recommended Storage Alternatives

#### Redis Implementation
```php
// Example Redis storage backend
add_filter('wpgraphql_subscription_storage', function() {
    return new WPGraphQL_Subscription_Redis_Storage([
        'host' => 'redis-server',
        'port' => 6379,
        'ttl' => 86400 // 24 hours
    ]);
});
```

#### Benefits of Redis/External Storage:
- üöÄ **Much faster** - In-memory operations vs database queries
- üîÑ **Automatic expiry** - TTL-based cleanup, no cron jobs needed  
- üìà **Better scaling** - Handles thousands of concurrent connections
- üåê **Multi-server support** - Shared storage across multiple WordPress instances

### Monitoring & Optimization

#### Database Query Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor slow queries related to subscriptions
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
SELECT * FROM information_schema.PROCESSLIST WHERE INFO LIKE '%wpgraphql_subscription%';
```

#### Key Metrics to Watch
- Database connection pool usage
- Query execution times on subscription tables
- Memory usage of long-running SSE processes
- Event queue growth rate

#### Optimization Tips
```php
// Reduce event queue retention
add_filter('wpgraphql_subscription_event_retention_hours', function() {
    return 1; // Keep events for 1 hour instead of 24
});

// Increase cleanup frequency  
wp_clear_scheduled_hook('wpgraphql_subscription_cleanup');
wp_schedule_event(time(), 'every_15_minutes', 'wpgraphql_subscription_cleanup');
```
