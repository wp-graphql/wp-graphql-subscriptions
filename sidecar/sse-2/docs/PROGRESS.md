## Key Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ **Architecture Decisions**
1. **Minimal approach**: No GraphQL execution engine, delegate to WPGraphQL
2. **Protocol compliance**: Follow GraphQL-SSE specification exactly
3. **Distinct connections mode**: One SSE connection per subscription
4. **Security first**: HMAC token validation for all WPGraphQL requests
5. **Subscription-only**: Reject queries and mutations with helpful errors

### ‚úÖ **Technology Choices**
1. **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
2. **Minimal dependencies**: node-fetch, redis, graphql parsing only
3. **No frameworks**: Pure Node.js HTTP server
4. **Redis pub/sub**: Reuse existing infrastructure
5. **Structured logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs

### ‚úÖ **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Phase-based development**: Clear milestones and deliverables
2. **Test-driven**: Write tests alongside implementation
3. **Documentation first**: Complete specs before coding
4. **Incremental delivery**: Each phase produces working software
5. **Performance focus**: Optimize for real-world usage patterns

## Lessons Learned from SSE-1

### ‚ùå **What to Avoid**
- Complex schema transformation
- GraphQL execution engine overhead
- Mixing concerns (queries + subscriptions)
- Framework lock-in (GraphQL Yoga)
- Over-engineering the proxy layer

### ‚úÖ **What to Reuse**
- Redis pub/sub patterns
- Security token approach
- Channel naming strategy
- WPGraphQL introspection
- Subscription lifecycle management

### üéØ **Key Improvements**
- Single responsibility (subscriptions only)
- Protocol compliance (GraphQL-SSE)
- Simpler architecture (minimal dependencies)
- Better error messages (helpful for developers)
- Focused performance (optimize for subscriptions)

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
- [ ] **Phase 1**: HTTP server accepts subscriptions, rejects others
- [ ] **Phase 2**: SSE connections established, events streamed
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Subscriptions stored and managed correctly
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Redis events received and routed properly
- [ ] **Phase 5**: WPGraphQL execution working with security
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Production-ready with monitoring

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **Latency**: <50ms from Redis event to SSE delivery
- [ ] **Throughput**: 1000+ concurrent subscriptions
- [ ] **Memory**: <1MB per 100 active subscriptions
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage
- [ ] **Protocol Compliance**: Pass all GraphQL-SSE tests
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete API and deployment docs
- [ ] **Security**: No vulnerabilities in security review

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Initialize project structure** (Phase 1.1)
2. **Set up package.json** with minimal dependencies
3. **Create TypeScript configuration** 
4. **Implement basic HTTP server** (Phase 1.2)

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Complete Phase 1** - Foundation setup
2. **Start Phase 2** - SSE protocol implementation
3. **Test with simple subscriptions**
4. **Validate protocol compliance**

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Complete Phases 2-4** - Core functionality
2. **Integration with Redis and WPGraphQL**
3. **Security implementation**
4. **Basic testing and optimization**

## Risk Assessment

### üü¢ **Low Risk**
- HTTP server implementation (well-understood)
- GraphQL parsing (using proven libraries)
- Redis integration (patterns from SSE-1)

### üü° **Medium Risk**
- SSE protocol compliance (new implementation)
- Connection management at scale (needs testing)
- WPGraphQL integration edge cases (auth, errors)

### üî¥ **High Risk**
- Performance under load (needs benchmarking)
- Memory leaks with many connections (needs monitoring)
- Security token implementation (critical for production)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental testing** at each phase
2. **Load testing** early and often
3. **Security review** before production
4. **Monitoring** built-in from the start
5. **Fallback plans** for critical components
