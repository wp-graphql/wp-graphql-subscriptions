# Changelog

All notable changes to the WPGraphQL Subscriptions Sidecar will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-20

### Phase 1.1 - Project Setup ‚úÖ
- Initial Node.js TypeScript project structure
- GraphQL Yoga, Redis, and GraphQL tools integration
- Comprehensive configuration management with environment variables
- Structured logging with Pino and pretty printing
- Build system and development tooling
- Environment configuration template
- Git ignore configuration
- Redis management npm scripts

### Phase 1.2 - Schema Management ‚úÖ
- WPGraphQL schema introspection with automatic discovery
- Schema caching mechanism with configurable TTL (5 minutes default)
- Graceful error handling and fallback to cached schema
- Schema invalidation and refresh capabilities
- Timeout handling for introspection requests
- Comprehensive logging for schema operations

### Phase 1.3 - Intelligent Proxy Functionality ‚úÖ
- **Content-based GraphQL operation detection** - detects GraphQL by request content, not URL patterns
- **Intelligent operation routing**:
  - Queries & Mutations ‚Üí Proxied to WPGraphQL
  - Subscriptions ‚Üí Pass through to custom handlers (ready for Phase 1.4)
- **Authentication passthrough** - forwards JWT tokens, cookies, and headers
- **HTTP client with timeout handling** using AbortController
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Request/response logging** for debugging
- **GraphQL operation type utilities** for robust operation detection
- **Non-GraphQL request passthrough** - ignores non-GraphQL requests

### Technical Improvements
- Modular TypeScript architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Robust error handling throughout the application
- Performance optimizations with connection pooling
- Developer experience enhancements (hot reload, debugging)
- Production-ready logging and monitoring capabilities

### Verified Functionality
- ‚úÖ Full WPGraphQL schema introspection and caching
- ‚úÖ All queries work exactly like direct WPGraphQL connection
- ‚úÖ All mutations work with proper authentication
- ‚úÖ Subscription operations detected and routed correctly
- ‚úÖ Non-GraphQL requests handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ Authentication headers forwarded properly
- ‚úÖ Error handling and graceful degradation

### Architecture
```
Client ‚Üí Yoga Sidecar ‚Üí [Queries/Mutations] ‚Üí WPGraphQL
                    ‚Üí [Subscriptions] ‚Üí Custom Handlers (Phase 1.4)
```

### Ready for Phase 1.4
The foundation is complete for implementing:
- Redis pub/sub integration
- SSE event streaming for subscriptions
- WordPress event triggers
- Real-time subscription functionality

---

### Phase 1.4 - Simple Subscription Support üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- ‚úÖ **Redis Client Integration** - Full pub/sub support with event handling and connection management
- ‚úÖ **Channel Naming Strategy** - Single-argument constraint with dual-channel publishing (specific + global)
- ‚úÖ **Subscription Manager** - Lifecycle management, Redis coordination, and subscription tracking
- ‚úÖ **GraphiQL Compatibility Fix** - Introspection queries handled locally to avoid WPGraphQL spec conflicts
- ‚úÖ **AST-based Operation Detection** - Robust GraphQL operation type detection using AST parsing
- ‚è≥ **SSE Subscription Resolvers** - Async iterable resolvers for real-time streaming (next)
- ‚è≥ **WordPress Event Integration** - Connect to existing `graphql_subscription_event` action hook
- ‚è≥ **Subscription Execution** - WPGraphQL filtering with event payload context

### Technical Improvements (Phase 1.4)
- Enhanced operation routing with introspection query detection
- Robust Redis client with automatic reconnection and error handling
- Channel builder with serialization support for complex argument types
- Subscription manager with comprehensive lifecycle tracking
- AST-based GraphQL parsing for accurate operation type detection

## Upcoming

### Phase 1.4 Completion (Next Steps)
- SSE subscription resolvers with async iterables
- WordPress event emission integration
- Real-time subscription execution and filtering
