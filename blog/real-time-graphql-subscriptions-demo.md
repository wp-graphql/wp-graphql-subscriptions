# Real-time GraphQL Subscriptions in WordPress - It Actually Works!

*30-45 second recording showing:*
- *Split screen: Apollo React demo (left) + webhook.site (right)*
- *You updating a post in WordPress admin (maybe in a third window/tab)*
- *Both clients updating simultaneously with real-time data*
- *Focus on the "wow moment" of simultaneous updates*

This is WordPress. No external services. No WebSocket servers. No Firebase or Supabase. Just WordPress + GraphQL making real-time subscriptions actually work.

## What You're Looking At

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: "apollo-demo-ui"]**
*Clean shot of the Apollo React demo showing:*
- *The subscription data displayed in real-time*
- *The GraphQL query being used*
- *Clean, modern React UI*

**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: "webhook-site-payload"]**
*webhook.site interface showing:*
- *Incoming real-time data from WordPress*
- *JSON payload structure*
- *Timestamp showing real-time delivery*

What you just saw is two completely different clients - a React application and a webhook endpoint - both subscribed to the same `postUpdated` GraphQL subscription. When I update a post in WordPress, both clients receive real-time data instantly, each getting exactly the fields they requested through their GraphQL queries.

The React app asks for:
```graphql
subscription {
  postUpdated(id: "394") {
    id
    title
    status
    author {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
    modified
  }
}
```

The webhook receives a different set of fields based on its subscription. Same event, different data, delivered simultaneously.

This isn't polling. This isn't a refresh button. This is WordPress pushing data to clients the moment something changes.

## Try It Yourself

Want to see this running on your own WordPress site?

- *4 demo options available*
- *Clean, inviting interface*
- *Setup instructions visible*

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repo**: [wp-graphql/wp-graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-subscriptions)
2. **Install the plugin** in your WordPress site
3. **Navigate to** `/wp-content/plugins/wp-graphql-subscriptions/client/test-demos.html`
4. **Choose any demo** and follow the on-screen instructions
5. **Update a post** in WordPress admin and watch the magic happen!

**Important**: This is experimental software that changes frequently. I've only tested it on LocalWP with specific nginx/php-fpm configurations (detailed in the README). Your mileage may vary on different hosting environments.

**Fair warning**: This is a proof of concept, not production software. Breaking changes happen daily. Don't use this in production... yet.

## Why This Matters

For the first time, WordPress can push data to clients in real-time using the same GraphQL schema you already know and love.

Think about what this enables:

- **Collaborative editing**: Multiple users editing the same content with live updates
- **Real-time dashboards**: WooCommerce order updates, analytics, content moderation
- **Live notifications**: Comments, mentions, status changes
- **Multi-user applications**: Project management, team collaboration, live chat

WordPress has always had a powerful event system through actions and filters, but those events lived and died within a single request-response cycle. Only the current user's browser knew about them. 

With GraphQL subscriptions, those same WordPress events can now notify any number of connected clients instantly. WordPress becomes a real-time data source, not just a content repository.

## How It Works (The Technical Teaser)

**[GIF PLACEHOLDER: "technical-flow"]**
*Shorter clip (15-20 seconds) showing:*
- *Browser dev tools with Network tab open*
- *GraphQL-SSE protocol requests: PUT → POST → GET*
- *EventSource connection streaming data*
- *Keep it brief but show this follows a real protocol*

This implementation follows the [GraphQL-SSE protocol specification](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) - it's not a custom solution, but a standards-based approach to GraphQL subscriptions over Server-Sent Events.

Here's the magic behind the scenes:

1. **Client makes a reservation** (PUT request) to establish a connection token
2. **Client registers a GraphQL subscription** (POST request) with their specific query
3. **Client opens an SSE stream** (GET request) to receive real-time updates
4. **WordPress events trigger notifications** through the existing action/filter system
5. **Matching subscriptions get real-time data** pushed through the SSE connection

The challenging parts I had to solve:

- **Multi-process safety**: PHP's request-response model means different processes can't easily share data. I built a database event queue that works across multiple PHP processes.
- **Connection management**: Tracking which clients are subscribed to which events, handling disconnections and reconnections gracefully.
- **LocalWP configuration**: Getting nginx and php-fpm to handle multiple long-lived SSE connections required some tweaking.

The system stores subscription documents in the database (swappable with Redis or other storage backends) and uses WordPress's native event system to trigger real-time updates.

## Try It, Break It, Tell Me About It

I want to know:
- Does it work in your environment?
- What breaks when you try it?
- What use cases are you excited about?
- What questions do you have about how it works?

**Ways to reach me**:
- Comments on this post
- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-subscriptions/issues) on the repo
- Slack/Discord DMs (@jasonbahl)

This is experimental software, but it's working software. I'm excited to see what the WordPress community thinks about bringing real-time capabilities to our favorite platform.

**Go try the demo. I think you'll be impressed by what WordPress can do.**
